We're only two weeks from the very first screening of [Imprint](http://imprintfilm.com), the short film for which I am both an actor and producer. It's been accepted into the [London Short Film Showcase](http://www.londonshortfilmshowcase.com) happening on Saturday, November 5 at Museum London. The showcase will be the first screening of a project that has stolen my heart for the past 3 months.

We just launched a [new website for the film](http://imprintfilm.com), which includes an updated trailer, a [free download of the film's soundtrack](http://imprintfilm.bandcamp.com) (including a [cover of the Antlers song "Kettering"](http://vimeo.com/30060451) by my new band [Burn Like Fabulous](http://burnlikefabulous.com)), screening dates and locations, and a list of credits for the film.

Speaking of screenings, I'm really excited to announce the [second screening of the film](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=299817186695644) happening on Sunday, November 6 at FitzRays at Dundas and Talbot in Downtown London. Burn Like Fabulous will be playing some of our favourite songs, and my dear friend [Carly Thomas](http://carlythomas.com) will be opening the night with her beautiful music.

If you can't tell, I'm incredibly excited about this film project. I've never been part of something like this. From filming until 4am in the morning to having the cops called on three separate occasions to staying up multiple nights editing to seeing a forklift lifting a demolished Lincoln and dropping it in front of a telephone pole just so we could re-shoot a 30-second shot; it was totally worth it even if the film never makes a dime. The skills, knowledge, and friendships I've developed over the course of the project were well worth the cost.

If you're in the area, I'd love to see you come out to [one](http://www.londonshortfilmshowcase.com) of the [two](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=299817186695644) screenings happening in November. For those who can't make one of the screenings, I'll be sharing details about how you can see the film in the next little while.
