I became a fan of [Rdio](http://rdio.com) some time ago. I liked that I could easily see what my friends were listening to, and could listen to an album on-the-go without having to download it to my iPhone.

I started using Rdio in a site-specific browser. I had created an icon in the same vein as the [Grooveshark icon](http://patdryburgh.com/blog/grooveshark-ssb-icon/) I was using. Shortly after designing the icon, I decided to uninstall flash, rendering my Rdio browser useless. The icon I designed was [never released](http://dribbble.com/shots/55139-Unauthorized-Rdio-Icon).

When Rdio came out with a new Mac app that didn't require Flash, I was really excited to for it to become a staple in my dock. What I wasn't prepared for was the rather [boring icon](http://cl.ly/0P2I0I393J2Z1L0O410G).

So, I dusted off the old icon I had made for the site-specific browser, and replaced that boring old square. I've had it there a few weeks now, and have been really happy with it. Then today I thought, maybe others might like the same thing?

So, here it is, available for you to [download](http://cl.ly/FcSX). I hope you enjoy!
