My dear friend, [Carly Thomas](http://carlythomas.com), has just released an album of acoustic renditions of some of her best songs. I was honoured to be included on the holiday-themed closing track, Hold You (On Christmas Eve).

It's been a while since I last travelled down the road playing guitar with Carly. Listening to this album brings back some truly wonderful memories of nights spent across this great country.

If you're into physical media, you can get a CD and some cool artwork by [visiting her online store](http://carlythomas.bigcartel.com/).
