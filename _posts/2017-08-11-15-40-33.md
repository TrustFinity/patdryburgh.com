Today is my last day in Uganda. Tomorrow, I fly to Zambia for a couple weeks, then I'm off to Newfoundland to go camping with my brother.

To say these last four and a half months have been amazing would be an understatement. I will miss the dear friends I've made since coming here, but am looking forward to the day when I can visit again.
