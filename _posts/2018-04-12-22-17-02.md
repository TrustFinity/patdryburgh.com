I am really enjoying [this album][ta] by [Made Mountain][mm]. It's very musically interesting without being extravagant. It has the feeling that a group of musicians sat around in a studio one Saturday and jammed out a great record, so it came as a surprise to see the majority of the instruments were played by one person: Robbie Manson. 

On his beautifully designed website, Manson also wrote what I wish I had available to me over a decade ago when I recorded and released my first EP: instructions for [how to self-release an album][ht].
