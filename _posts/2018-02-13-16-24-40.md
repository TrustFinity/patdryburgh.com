I am longtime fan and advocate of [Jonathan Snook's colour contrast checker][js], but today found myself wanting a similar tool for Sketch. [Stark][st] is a Sketch plug-in created by Cat Noone, Michael Fouquet, and Benedikt Lehnert that makes checking the contrast between two layers a breeze. Stark also allows you to simulate various forms of colour blindness, a valuable tool for those who care about designing for accessibility.
