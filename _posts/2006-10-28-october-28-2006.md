last night was incredible.  led worship at a youth outreach event in st. catherines.  it was at a huge church called niagara celebration church, pastored by peter youngren.  it was an amazing event, with probably 100+ mostly unchurched kids out.  they had a huge inflatables section, ping pong and other sweet games, and a great youth worship band.  we rocked out for a good hour, finishing our set off by inviting their youth band on stage to play "everyday" with us.  it was amazing. 

it was one of those nights where anything that you wish wouldn't happen did.  ty had some major troubles getting to the show, and the sound wasn't great, but the spirit and what God was doing in the kids hearts and in my own was truly amazing.
