I've just published the source code for the pre-release of my very first open source Jekyll theme, [Hitchens](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens). Inspired by the cover of the [trade paperback version](https://www.amazon.com/Arguably-Essays-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/1455502782) of [*Arguably*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arguably) by Christopher Hitchens, the theme is designed to present thoughtful content in a thoughtful manner.

I have [documented a couple of ideas](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/issues) for features I'd like to add before releasing this theme for production and would be grateful if you would share your own.

If you'd like to test it out before it's ready for production, have a look at the theme's [README file](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens) for instructions on how to set it up and [let me know](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/issues) about any issues you discover.
