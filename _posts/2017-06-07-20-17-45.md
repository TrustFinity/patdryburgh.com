About a month ago, I combed through the roughly 60 feeds in my feed reader in order to remove any that had gone dormant. Almost half had not posted in the last year.

I found myself nodding my head as I read [Zhu's blog post][zhu] about returning from vacation to relatively few updates in her feed reader. Many of the friends I have made online have moved the vast majority of their publishing to social media. While the immediacy of social media is great, it's an art form of brevity. Blog posts allowed for long form expression unmatched by any medium before or since.

I have personally rededicated myself to my blog. Hopefully I can inspire a few others to do the same.
