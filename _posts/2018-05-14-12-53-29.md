This article from Segment's [Jeroen Ransijn][jr] was a real gut punch for me. I recently attempted to apply the exact same strategy to a project I'm currently working on, but differs from my experience as I have thus far failed in my execution.

Where I think I went wrong was when I decided against bringing the newly created design system into an older, existing project I was later asked to help with. My reasoning at the time was to avoid conflicts with the _multiple_ other design libraries already in use by developers who had worked on the project before I joined. This decision has prevented me from being able to continue evangelizing the design system I had created to the organization, leaving my poor design system in the dust.

Jeroen'a excellent article is part of a new ongoing project called [DesignSystems.com][ds], “a resource for learning, creating, and evangelizing design systems” by [Figma][fi][^1]. Really excited to dig deeper into this resource over the next few days.

[^1]: The collaborative design tool I wish [Danny Robinson][dr] and I would have thought to create back in 2013 while we used Google Slides to remotely design [Perch][pe] 3.0.
