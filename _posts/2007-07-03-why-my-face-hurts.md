Hey everyone,

I just wanted to ask for your prayers over the next few days. Late Sunday night I was assaulted in downtown London, leaving me with a few fractured and broken bones to my face. The attack was totally unprovoked, but pretty serious nonetheless.

Right now my face is pretty swollen on the right side, but thanks to some meds I'm not feeling too bad. I am waiting to hear from a plastic surgeon whether or not I will need surgery for my face.

I am really asking that my friends will pray for me, for my family as they cope with what's happened, and for everyone else who is close to me that are affected by this. I hope that I'll be back and ready to go back to my life as soon as I can be.
