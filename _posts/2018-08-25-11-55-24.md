The latest — and hopefully last! — pre-release of the [Hitchens Theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/) is [available now](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/releases/tag/v0.4.1). I could really use some help testing it before I release the 1.0. The sooner it's tested, the sooner I can submit it to [@manton](http://micro.blog/manton) to be [added to Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/manton/789622#post_div_789622) :)
