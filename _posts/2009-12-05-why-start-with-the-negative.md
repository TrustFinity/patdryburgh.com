What is up with this trend of people writing blog posts tearing down other people’s designs, social media strategies, etc? Since when was public humiliation a good way to

- build relationships?
- garner business?
- prove you are a professional?

I know I’ve not been perfect with this. I’m very opinionated, and on many occasions have spoken way out of turn to share them. Perhaps I’m doing the same thing here, but I’m just getting tired of all the negativity.

I really wish sites like [Typesites](http://typesites.com) would come back, as they had a way of pointing out the absolute best in the sites they reviewed before they offered helpful tips to push the designs to further excellence.
