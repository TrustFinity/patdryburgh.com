This year's [Jack Richardson Award nominees have been announced][jr] and I'm really excited to see my friend [Michael Marucci][mm] nominated for best Producer/Engineer of the year for “You Left Me With a Kiss” by [Karen Emeny][ke]. I had the honour of playing lead guitar on this track, which [you can listen to for free on Bandcamp][bc].

Also pleased to see my dear friend and collaborator [Carly Thomas][ct] nominated for Best Contemporary Singer/Songwriter. It's been a couple of years since our last journey together on the [open road][or] and I'm really starting to miss it.
