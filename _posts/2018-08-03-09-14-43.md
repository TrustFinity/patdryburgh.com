[RubyGems claims](https://rubygems.org/gems/hitchens-theme) that the [Hitchens gem](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/) has been downloaded 120 times, yet Github's traffic stats show the repository only has 14 unique visitors and 2 stars. Anyone know why there would be such a large discrepancy?
