This past weekend, I was on the receiving end of two acts of incredible kindness from two incredibly talented people.

[Edward Platero](http://edwardplatero.com)—who shot and produced both Boss Rebel [music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMH8qbLRuLw) [videos](http://vimeo.com/27176349) as well as the [video I did for John Siracusa's Lion review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhOG25fM8so)—lent me thousands of dollars worth of video recording equipment, including his Canon 5D Mark II which I have since fallen madly in love with. His generosity led to some of the most memorable moments I've had in the past few months, which I am happy to say will be shared once the project I'm working on is fully baked.

Today I took my Macbook Pro into the Apple Store to see about fixing an unresponsive key and replacing an old battery. I had gone in expecting to wait a couple of hours for the repairs to be completed, only to have my expectations crushed into the ground when I discovered it would be nearly a **week and a half** before I could have my precious computer back. My Macbook Pro is my work machine, which means I make my living off of it and it alone. I was dumbstruck. I did not know what I would do.

My friend [Avery Edison](http://averyedison.com)—whom I had borrowed the camera from Ed to film—offered to lend me her Macbook Pro until mine had been returned. Quite frankly, I was blown away by the offer and at first declined it. She made the offer again, this time forcing me to accept. I couldn't and still can't believe that she would sacrifice her work and productivity for my own.

Thank you, Edward and Avery, for once again showing me kindness. I'll never forget it.
