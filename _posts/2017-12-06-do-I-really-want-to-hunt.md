My [post from the other day](http://patdryburgh.com/blog/becoming-a-meateater/) definitely came out of left field. I had just finished reading Steven Rinella's book, [Meateater](https://www.amazon.com/Meat-Eater-Adventures-American-Hunter/dp/0385529821), and was all amped up to figure this hunting thing out.

What I didn't do a very good job explaining was that this idea is still _very new_, and like all good ideas it has not yet been fully tested.

Do I actually want to kill an animal? I have no idea. I can probably count on one hand the number of fish I've killed, pets included. I once went to a firing range on my way to a [Mutemath](http://www.mutemath.com/) concert in Detroit, but other than that, the vast majority of my firearms experience is with BB guns and [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt). 

So, I'm definitely in the romantic stage of this endeavour where it's an exotic idea that has not yet had to face the harshness of reality.

Right now, I love climbing mountains and I am falling in love with cooking. With these things comes the question “am I being responsible with how I'm sourcing the food that I eat?” At the moment, I believe the answer is “no, not really” and that hunting may be a solution to this problem.

Or maybe sitting under fluorescent lights and eating lunch in a food court for the last two weeks is making me stir crazy and I just really want to get outside.
