I'm having an amazing time with my family down here in Florida this week, but I wanted to stop by the blog to make a quick announcement.

The [Fusion Ad Network](http://fusionads.net) is an exclusive ad network targeted at creative professionals. I greatly admire both [Chris](http://log.chrisbowler.com) and [Michael](http://michaelmistretta.com) who lead the company, the blogs and websites that make up the network, and also the products and services they choose to advertise. The ads are tasteful, unobtrusive, and best of all, relevant.

I am please to announce that I have been invited to join the network of blogs and sites that make up the Fusion network. To be honest, I feel very much out of my league, but am honoured that the team felt my site matched the quality of their network.

I also want to take the time to thank you for reading my blog. I know I have gone through a lot of transitions with it over the past year, and not everything I've said I would do has come to pass. I apologize for not always sticking to my word when it comes to what I plan to write on my blog. Thank you for your patience, your loyalty, and above all your friendship in this crazy journey of blogging. Here's to many more exciting years to come!
