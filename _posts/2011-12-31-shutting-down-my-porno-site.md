It was pretty. Damn it was pretty. The subjects were all scantily clad in accessories and the lighting was just right. Whether it was an image I found on the web or a self-shot photo submitted by a reader, my standard was always “will this make my readers' jaws drop?”

But, it was bullshit. It was *such* bullshit. We were creating this completely unrealistic ideal that no one should have to live up to.

*Who has the most minimal desk setup?*

The real question is, **who gives a fuck?**

I started Simple Desks—a Tumblr site for collecting photographs of minimal desks and work setups—back on March 15, 2010. Its initial purpose was simple: I was having a desk custom built by a friend, and I wanted an easy way of saving photos to use as inspiration. Tumblr's bookmarklet was the easiest way I could think of to simply keep an archive of the photos I found, without having to clog up my own hard drive.

Shorty after I started the site, I published a link to it on Twitter and asked if anyone had a photo of their desk they wanted to share, feel free to submit it. Eighteen months later I had published over 350 photographs of people's desks.

*Desks.*

Empty, lifeless, *work*less desks.

About 6 months into running Simple Desks I began realizing that what I was doing was running a porn site. No, not topless girls and chest-hairless guys romping around in a beach house-type porn. Just pointless, casual, *look-at-this-empty-fucking-desk-you'll-never-have* porn.

And we were all getting off on it.

But I kept it up. I kept it up because, baby, it *paid*. Not in the thousands-of-dollars-a-month type of paid, but certainly more than what a guy publishing photos of desks should deserve.

Then, in October of this year we finished the [short film](http://imprintfilm.com) my friends and I spent countless hours on, and I realized how incredibly proud I was of that and how excited I was to share it with people. I never felt that way about posting desk pictures. Never.

So, I started thinking about shutting it down. Once I returned home from LA in early December, the decision had been made: as of 2012, Simple Desks would be no more.

And, if I had any doubts about whether this was the right thing to do, hearing [Merlin Mann](http://merlinmann.com) and [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com) discuss the fetishism of minimalism on a [recent episode of Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w/46) quickly put them to rest.

I want to spend my time creating work that is substantial. To hear someone tell me that a scene in Imprint made them tear up, that a lyric in a song I've written has uplifted someone who was down, or to see users enjoy using something I've created on the web, these are the moments I want to experience more often. These are moments for humans.
