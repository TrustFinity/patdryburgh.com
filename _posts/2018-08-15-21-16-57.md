This is how I recorded [this one's for Roland](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/08/15/p1-instamic-wave-instamic-microblog/) ([@rtanglao](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1029924503353090048))

1. Created a [Workflow](http://workflow.is) based on a previous Workflow I had created for posting to my Jekyll site from my iPhone via [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)
2. Added steps for recording and previewing the audio, encoding it to MP3 and then base64 and storing that as a variable
3. Pass the base64 string through an x-callback URL that writes the file to my local repository
4. Come back to Workflow to paste this text into a text field
5. Store this text as a variable
6. Pass that variable through to my standard x-callback URL for posting content on this site
7. Frantically refresh my blog hoping I can spot and fix any bugs before Roland notices.
