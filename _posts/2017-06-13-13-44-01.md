Great news for security-conscious users of [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com), the journaling app for iOS and MacOS. Generating and saving the encryption key on iOS was quick and easy. Getting the newly encrypted journal into the Mac app was a bit less obvious. Rather than selecting an existing journal or adding a new one, you have to sign back into your Day One account and allow the app to sync before you can see and unlock your end-to-end encrypted journal.
