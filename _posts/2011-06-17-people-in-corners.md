The [Rule of Thirds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds). All of us have either used it or heard our designer/photographer/artist friends mention it when discussing the compositions of their creations. Placing the subject on one of the four intersections created by dividing the canvas into nine equal parts increases tension, energy, and interest in the composition.

Sometimes, though, rules are meant to be broken. As I was walking around downtown Barrie yesterday afternoon, I decided to break the rule of thirds. I wanted to show the contrast between people and the space surrounding them. We live in a big world, and I wanted to communicate that.

Hope you enjoy.
