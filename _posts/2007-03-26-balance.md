It has been 19 days since my last update, and while some may think I've simply been neglectful, it's actual simply been a matter of balance. And so, with that in mind, I will delve into one of the pitfalls many in ministry find themselves in, especially when they first begin.

Whenever you start a new job, ministry or otherwise, you want to make sure you give it your all. You work extra hard (all the time, not just when the boss is near), you put in those extra hours, you make sure you're connecting with your fellow staff so they know you're a great employee willing to go that "extra mile." For many people (and in the past this had included myself), this drive lasts a few weeks, at which time reality sets in and work simply becomes a means to an end. I say this has been me in the past, because not until now have I worked at a job where I've felt so passionately called. Over the last four weeks, these are the hours I've put in:

- Week One: 62 Hours
- Week Two: 59 Hours
- Week Three: 41 Hours
- Week Four: 55 Hours (plus one all-nighter)

So it's become apparent to me that I need to really focus on tightening up my schedule. I think a lot of that goes back to the practice of "working on it, not in it." I need to look at what I need done, and how I do it, and make sure I'm doing those things not only to the best of my ability but also to the greatest level of efficiency.
