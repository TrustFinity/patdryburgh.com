Just got this in my inbox this morning. From Nadine Russell:

>Not sure if you heard but Cindy opened her eyes 4 times today in response to her sister talking to her. Mandy believes that she is responding to Mandy asking - if you understand and know that I’m here open your eyes, and she is. She also moved her leg a bit as well. Her vitals are good, and she is progressing as she needs to be. The doctors are still saying it’s 50/50 but today was a very good sign. She rested well last night. She is still on track for surgery on Monday.
