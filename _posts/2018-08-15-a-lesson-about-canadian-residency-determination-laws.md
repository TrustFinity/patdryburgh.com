If you're a Canadian citizen and plan to leave Canada for more than 183 days of the calendar year, make sure you first file an [NR73](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr73.html) form to establish your [residency status](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html). I wasn't aware of this law until a month ago when the Canada Revenue Agency demanded an additional $4,100 in taxes because I was out of the country for two weeks longer than permitted.

I have submitted an NR73 for the 2017 tax year and hope that I can prove I had maintained close ties to the country — all of my personal belongings, my family, and my common law partner were all here while I was away — but there's no guarantee that they'll change their determination.

Had I known about this law at the time, I probably would have used a tool [like this one from Nomad List](https://mobile.twitter.com/levelsio/status/1021737472433111042), which tracks the number of days you are out of your home country.

Now all I have to worry about is what could happen when I plan to return to Uganda.

If you're planning to live a nomadic lifestyle, please learn from my mistake.
