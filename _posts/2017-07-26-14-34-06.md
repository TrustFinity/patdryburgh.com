A really nifty (and cleverly named) app that blocks websites on your iOS devices. Previously, I had been using parental controls to [block Facebook](http://patdryburgh.com/micro/2017-06-15-21-19-16) and other time-wasting sites, however the controls were a bit cumbersome and overbearing for my limited needs. about:blank does exactly what I want, no more, no less.
