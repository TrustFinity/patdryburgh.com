Well, I am down here in Nashville right now, soaking in the Gospel Music Association's Music Week.  It has been incredible so far, and it's only been two nights!  Tonight we shared a time of worship with lead worshippers Charlie Hall, David Crowder, and Chris Tomlin, with a fantastic message from Louie Giglio about the supremacy of Jesus.  It was one of the most refreshing times of worship I have had in a long time. 

After the worship time was a very intimate Songwriter's Showcase featuring acoustic performances of this year's best songs.  Artists included Third Day, Matthew West, Joy Williams, Bebo Norman, Mark Hall of Casting Crowns, and many more.

We've also been meeting up with some home-grown bands, including Manic Drive, Starfield (who is releasing a new album in May), Jon Steingard of Hawk Nelson (who is releasing their new album on Tuesday), and a few more.  We've also been hooking up with lots of artists and companies here in the US.  It's been a great experience so far, and we've got about 3-4 more days to go!
