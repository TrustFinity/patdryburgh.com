Over the past few weeks I have become increasingly interested in user interface design, and even more specifically icon design. I have never had the opportunity to create an icon, and wanted to give it a shot.

A couple weeks ago I began using [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/) for my absolutely favourite online music service, [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/). I tried searching for a good icon to use, however came up short. On Friday I opened up Photoshop, and took to the task myself.

Using the amazing Grooveshark logo developed by the incredible [David Pache](http://dache.ch/), I took to designing the icon. I wanted to make sure I adhered as best I could to [Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/userexperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/index.html) (HIG), and made sure to include appropriate lighting and shadows.

Special thanks to [John Ashenden](http://johnwithanh.com/) for his advice and encouragement.

To use the icon for your own Grooveshark app, [download the .zip file](/downloads/gs-icon.zip) and follow the included instructions.
