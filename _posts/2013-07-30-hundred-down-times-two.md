Wow, what a whirlwind the last two weeks have been. I'm feeling incredibly stressed and anxious about several things going on in my life at the moment, but in the last two days I'm starting to come up out of the fog and into the sun. It's a lot more clear up here.

Anyway, in the midst of all this madness, I did have the opportunity to record two episodes of the Hundred Down podcast. Last week, the guys and I talked about, well, [pretty much everything I'm either doing wrong or not doing at all][1].

This week, however, was a super special week. Not only was I joined by my two good friends Bill and Ed, but we also had a very special guest. I already spoiled the surprise on Twitter, so I won't ruin it for you. [Have a listen; I think you'll enjoy it][2] :)
