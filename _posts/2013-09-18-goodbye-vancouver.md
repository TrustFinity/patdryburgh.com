I moved from London, Ontario to Vancouver, British Columbia a little over a year ago to join [Perch][2] as the Sr. UX Designer. In that time, I have designed 3 versions of the app[^1], watched us grow from a team of 4 to a team of 8, and been part making what I believe is [a new beginning][1] in the way we experience communication.

The past 16 months have been amazing, but like all good things my time at Perch is coming to an end.[^2] Two weeks have gone by since I handed in my resignation, and my last day will be September 27.

At the end of the month I will be driving back to Ontario to spend time with my mom who has been battling cancer for some time now. My friend [Ed][3] will be joining me for the ride, my first time across Canada.

What will I be doing when I get back to Ontario? Good question, but not one I can answer at this time. What I can tell you is that it won't be anything I've done before.

I have two special announcements for those in the Vancouver area. First, I'm having a party at my place Friday night. I know this is the Internet, but I still think you should come. [Email me][4] for the time and location.

Second, because my little Mazda 3 Sport can't tow a trailer, I need to sell my furniture. There's a [bed][5], a [sofa bed][6], and a [patio couch][7] listed on Craigslist that, I think, would look *so* good in your place.

I did not expect I would leave Vancouver so soon. I'm really going to miss working with Danny, Steve, Ian, Lance, Adam, Edward, and Pete. I'm really going to miss the amazing friends I've made. I'm *really* going to miss the sushi.

But, don't fret. I'll be back to visit soon.

[^1]: With numerous iterations in between.
