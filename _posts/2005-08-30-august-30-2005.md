Got back last night from a weekend at Darien Lake.  Rode the superman 3 times, which was awesome.  Also, the light/fireworks/laser show at night was amazing!  I really want to own a krypton-argon laser now.  

Finished the last week at camp on Friday.  Glad that's done.  Not that I didn't enjoy it, but 7 weeks is enough for me.  Overall the summer was pretty good.  There were some issues with the directors and such, but other than that things went well.  I learned a lot this summer, about waiting on God (in a real, practical sense), how if we trust God he'll give us the desires of our hearts, and once again how fun spooning is. 

Got a call from the church in Brampton...kinda playing phone tag with them right now.  Hopefully we'll get something worked out.  I am really torn by this whole thing, wanting to go to work at an awesome church, and staying so that I can be with my amazing girlfriend.  I really don't want to leave Sarah, again, but as of right now that's where things are lookin' to go.  Unless I get a call from New Hope Community Church in London sometime soon. 

Anyways, that's all I really want to write today.  Take care.
