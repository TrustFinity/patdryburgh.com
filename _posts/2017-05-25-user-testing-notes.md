Thank you to everyone who attended the first ever [Indonesian product design livestream][ipd] hosted by [Viral Foundry][vf]. It was an honour to share with you the lessons I've learned about improving products through user testing. I hope each of you took something away that you'll be able to apply to your own craft.

I do apologize for my lack of visual slides. In the past, I've found slides to be a hindrance to my style of presentation. However, some of the feedback I received from Kenny following the presentation indicated that I wasn't fully considerate of the language barriers between us. Were I to give this talk again, I will certainly take this feedback to heart.

As promised during the presentation, I want to share with you some notes and links from my talk. If you were an attendee and see that I've missed something, please [hit me up on Twitter][pt] and let me know.

I hope I was able to convey just how great of an impact employing user testing can have on both the usability and viability of your product. My thanks to [Kenny][ke] and the whole Viral Foundry team for hosting the event.

[^1]: Not really a “book”, but this site is so jam-packed with useful information about running a design sprint, I had to include it. In fact, this guide helped me understand what improvements were needed to be made following [my first design sprint][fds].
