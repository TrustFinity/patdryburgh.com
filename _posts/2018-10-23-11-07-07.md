I've known [Tyler Finck](https://tylerfinck.com) for almost 10 years. I say I've known him, but truly I've known his online presence. From the super cool [horizontal scroll design](https://github.com/sursly/Horizontal-Scroller) he created for his old portfolio site, Sursly.com, to the wildly popular [Blackout](https://www.tylerfinck.com/shop/blackout-3-0/) font, to his beautiful [photography](https://www.tylerfinck.com/photography/), Tyler is one of those people whose work has and continues to inspire me. Heck, I used his [Lickety Split](https://www.tylerfinck.com/shop/lickety-split/) font for the [4015 Productions logo](https://dribbble.com/shots/1517364-4015-co) even before Barack Obama used [Ostrich Sans](https://www.tylerfinck.com/typefaces/ostrich-sans-font/) for his [Believe campaign](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/482193611535040512).

And that's not to mention the [beautiful music](https://www.tylerfinck.com/music/) he's written and produced that has become a staple of my musical rotation.

The interactions I've had with Tyler through Twitter, Instagram, and Strava have always been positive and uplifting. He's often one of the first if not only people to say nice things about my work, and that means a lot to me.

I write all of this as a way to explain that while I've never met Tyler in person, I'm incredibly proud of him for the launch of his new type foundry, [ETC](https://etc.supply/). Like the rest of his work, the site for ETC is bold and beautiful. Even cooler than that is that with every font you purchase, Tyler will send you [a hat](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn_jeLfDuR2/?taken-by=etceteratypeco)!

I just purchased [Grandstander](https://etc.supply/fonts/grandstander/), a playful display I plan to use for a future product for [A Wonderful Shop of Wonderful Wonders](http://awonderful.shop).

Congratulations on the launch, Tyler. Best wishes on the new venture!
