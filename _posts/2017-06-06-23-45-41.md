For some reason, the post link wasn't appearing in the tweet despite the fact it appears as expected in the [feed](http://feed.patdryburgh.com/twitter). I've just set up an [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) recipe to see if that solves the issue.

I've been drafting a blog post explaining how I'm doing this as I work on it, which I will post as soon as I've confirmed this is working.
