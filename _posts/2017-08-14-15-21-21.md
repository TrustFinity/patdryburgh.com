The Consulate of Canada to Uganda is a disgrace. The desks are full of brochures with web addresses that return 404 or 403 errors (including one asking for feedback regarding my service here), pamphlets for events that took place over 2 years ago, and a Japanese takeout menu. Every school brochure is dated 2016 or earlier. I even found a religious pamphlet for Seventh Day Adventists.

I've now been waiting for the Consular to return from her lunch which was to have ended two hours ago. Her office staff can't reach her and have no idea where she is.

Oh, Canada.
