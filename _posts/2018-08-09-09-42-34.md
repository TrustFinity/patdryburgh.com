If you're new to Jekyll (or Git, or development in general) and are interested in contributing to a theme, I have a few [good first issues](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) listed in the repository. Great way to dip your feet in and learn!
