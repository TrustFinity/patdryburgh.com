A great [overview of changes coming to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.viget.com/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-wcag-2-1/) that were published back in June from [Peyton Chance at Viget](https://www.viget.com/about/team/pchance/).

My only complaint is that the article didn't include a single link to the guidelines, so [here they are](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)!
