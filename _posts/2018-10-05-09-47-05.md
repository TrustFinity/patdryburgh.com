Good news! I received a letter this morning from Canada Revenue Agency indicating that they now consider me to be a factual resident of Canada. The next step is to apply for a reassessment of last year's tax return which _should_ result in the reinstatement of the benefits that were taken away due to [the original determination](https://patdryburgh.com/blog/a-lesson-about-canadian-residency-determination-laws/). Fingers crossed!
