I bought this shirt when I was fat. It was too small for me, but I couldn't put it back on the rack. At the time I was toying around with the Paleo diet, and thought I'd be able to wear it in a few short months. I didn't stick with the diet at the time, so the shirt remained in a box in my storage locker.

My in-suite washing machine had been broken for a few weeks, and I was running out of clean tees.[^1] I hadn't thought about it in almost a year, but as I pulled the green article out of the box my eyes widened with excitement.

>I might be small enough to fit into this thing.

I put it on, and immediately felt the warmth of self confidence emanating from my chest.

It's the moustache that does it for me.
