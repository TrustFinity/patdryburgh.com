That's exactly how I feel in this moment. It's not easy to put yourself out there, to do something you've never done before and then show it to the world. But that's how we grow. That's how we become artists.

This past summer my friend [Edward](http://edwardplatero.com) approached me with a script he had written for a short film. He had written a part specifically with me in mind. The movie—a dramatic story of three friends grasping at one last chance to live—was full of intense dialogue and dealt with a very serious theme: death.

We shot the film over the past four weeks, and today are proud to release [the trailer](http://vimeo.com/29121559) for our short film, "Imprint."

Details for the movie's release are still pending, but I will be sure to let you know as soon as I have more information.

Thank you so much for watching, for sharing, and for your incredible support.
