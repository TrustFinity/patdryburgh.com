<p>I received an email this afternoon asking about my post about using <a href="http://patdryburgh.com/post/902785172/">high resolution images in a Tumblr photo post</a>. They had included the <code>{PhotoURL-HighRes}</code> tag  in their theme, but still the photos weren’t high&nbsp;resolution.</p>

<p><a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/83565864/high-res-photos">Tumblr has added</a> an extra (confusing) step to having high-res photos on your blog. To include high-res photos on your&nbsp;blog:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/customize">Customize</a> screen for your&nbsp;blog.</li>
<li>Select the “Advanced”&nbsp;menu.</li>
<li>Select “Enable high-res&nbsp;photos.”</li>
</ol>

<p>From what I’ve read, any high-res photo you have uploaded since October 2008 has still been stored on Tumblr’s servers, so this step really just allows your theme access to those photos. However, if I’m wrong you will need to re-upload all of the photos so that Tumblr has a high-res version on their&nbsp;site.</p>
