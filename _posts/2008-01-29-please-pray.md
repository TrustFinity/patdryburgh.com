I just received news that my good friend and the Assistant to the Lead Pastor at Connexus, Cindy Morris, was in a car accident this morning.  She was flown to the hospital and is still in critical care.  No one is sure of the extent of the injuries.

There is enough craziness going on this week (which I will post later this week) that this just sucks.  If you could, please pray for Cindy and her family (3 kids), and for the Connexus community that they will pull through.
