<p>An interesting meme has been developing over on <a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a>, a community of designers who share the things they are working on at the moment. Started by <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/69556-Utah">Geof Crowl</a>, designers have been creating postcards for the states and cities in which they live. Some places are well represented, while others may only have one or two graphics representing their&nbsp;location.</p>

<p>Given that I live in a small municipality of just over 13,000, I guessed that few fellow Dribbblers would share my locale<sup><a href="#48797" id="fn1" title="see footnote 1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So, I took the opportunity to represent my small&nbsp;region: </p>

<p>Other designers I admire have been creating beautiful postcards for their locales. Below are some of my&nbsp;favourites: </p>

<p>Of course, the Godfather of Dribbble <a href="http://simplebits.com">Mr. Cederholm</a>, has created one of the nicest postcards for the city of Salem, Massachusetts. Perhaps a few years older than Thames Centre; where they have witches, we’ve got soccer&nbsp;moms.</p>

<p>Few people have the creative talent that <a href="http://kylesteed.com">Kyle Steed</a> has. This beautiful postcard for his home in Dallas is part hand drawn and part Poloroid photograph; truly a perfect&nbsp;combination.</p>

<p>I do not know much about Norway, but from this by postcard by <a href="http://www.airo.no/">Troy Bergland</a>, it’s easy to tell that at least part of it is&nbsp;breathtaking.</p>

<p>One of my dreams has been to own a Volkswagen camper, and one of the places I would love to venture to in it is Arizona. The muted colours in this <a href="http://dribbble.com/system/users/1775/screenshots/70370/shot_1288048017.png">postcard</a> by <a href="http://www.hellocreative.com/">Matthew Spiel</a> are just&nbsp;perfect.</p>

<p>I have no real draw to go to France, but the mix of photography and type in this shot by <a href="http://www.areskub.com/">Stéphane Reverdy</a> are&nbsp;beautiful.</p>

<p>Several times in the recent past I have tried to set type within a scene, only to have it not quite fit within the overall landscape. In this postcard, however, <a href="http://jessbrown.me/">Jess Brown</a> has nailed the perspective and&nbsp;concept.</p>

<p>One of my favourite design agencies, <a href="http://paravelinc.com/">Paravel</a>, calls Austin, Texas home. One of Paravel’s partners, <a href="http://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a>, designed this <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/70667-Texas">antique-looking card</a> featuring a photo of his hometown, and of course a bit ole’ a perfect&nbsp;Star.</p>

<p>I love when designers take the time to flex their creative muscles outside of the bounds of their daily work. Good design should result in action; I think I may have some travelling to do this coming&nbsp;year.</p>
