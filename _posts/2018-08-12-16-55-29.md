Just pushed [the latest — and potentially last — pre-release of my first Jekyll theme, Hitchens](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/releases/tag/v0.3.0). I haven't found anyone willing to test it yet, so maybe you'll be the first? I would love some feedback before I release it for production.

You can view a demo and read the docs right from [the theme's Github repository](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/).
