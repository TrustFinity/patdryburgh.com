After an incredible 65 years of life, 44 years of marriage, 30 years of motherhood, and 4 years of fighting for her life, Mom passed away on the evening of July 7, 2014 at 11:38pm. The family was home and able to say goodbye before she passed, and she left peacefully knowing her husband and three children were with her.

Mom was an incredible woman. Her strength and love were the foundation of our family, and her compassion for those around her shone through everything she did. She graced the world with her creativity and passion, and stood for those who could not stand on their own. Every time I cut a peanut butter and jam sandwich into four little squares, when I'm walking to my car and realize I've forgotten something inside, and when I see someone in need, I'll remember her. She was good to her family and to the world.

Visitations will be held at A. Millard George (60 Ridout Street South, London, ON) on Thursday from 2–4 and 7–9pm and the funeral will take place on Friday at 11am. Relatives and friends of the family are encouraged to attend.

Thank you to all of our friends and family who have been walking this journey with our family these last four years, and a special thank you to Linda, Phil, and Dr. Chawla for their compassionate care. Your love and support has meant the world to us.
