Day two into my &ldquo;comeback&rdquo; with God, and already I’m having ideas float into my head. Some of them are small, such as how I can get more involved at Connections, how to start serving those in need, etc. Others are much more complex, daring, scary. One involves an idea I’ve never really had before, and scares the crap out of me.

This idea is to plant a church. 

In a fleeting moment yesterday, I had an enormous amount of ideas flow through my mind. Dreams, visions, ideas. One of the ideas was to one day plant a church. I don’t know where this idea came from, as last week I wasn’t even talking to God. And yet, here was this idea, burned on my mind. Now, the idea came with a bit of wisdom; I know that I am not yet in a place in my relationship with God, nor am I of the leadership capacity yet to even embark on something as crazy as this idea. However, it seemed like God was saying &ldquo;look, just get in with me, get into what I’m doing in the world, and this is where I’m taking you.&rdquo; I’ve honestly never had an experience like it before. 

Again, obviously I am not ready to even begin that journey yet. I still want to get into community at Connections, to grow in my faith again, to develop as a leader and communicator. I don’t dare to suggest that I’m in any way ready to take on such a responsibility yet. And, for all I know this is just a stupid, crazy idea I came up with on my own. I honestly don’t know. I just thought I’d share this crazy idea that I have and possibly gather some feedback. What do you think?
