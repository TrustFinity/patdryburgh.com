I cannot stand my school. 

I went to Ron today to ask if my band could once again use the chapel for band practice. All this entails on his part is for him to ask either Ry or Sam to let us in and out. Ryan was sitting right there the whole time, so he could've easily turned around and said "hey Ryan, can you let these guys in on Sunday?"  But no. Instead, he had to tell me that because I was half an hour late in asking him, I couldn't practice on Sunday. This is right after I led worship at the chapel for the school. 

Contrast this with a professor here at the school asking me the day before I had planned on going home for the weekend (something I haven't done since February) if I could lead worship for a "Walk-Thru-the-Bible" seminar the school was putting on. Of course I said yes. This isn't the first time something like this has happened either. 

It just seems to me that this school is very quick to request things from people that cause people to sacrifice something, when they aren't willing at all to budge on their "rules" or "guidelines."  This is exactly what I believe Jesus would want a church or other Christian organization to be like. 

Anyways, that's my rant for today. I hate Emmanuel Bible College.
