Since returning to full-time freelancing this past February, I've been using [Cushion][cu] to track my time, submit and track invoices, and forecast my income and expenses. Even though I'm not yet using the product to its full potential, the value I'm getting out of it is tremendous.

Recently, Cushion released an update to the user interface that I have found greatly improves the usability of the app. In his post explaining [the reasoning behind the change][tc], Jonnie Hallman promises to share more about the design process and technical challenges they faced. This is my public reminder that his team's fans are patiently waiting ðŸ˜‰
