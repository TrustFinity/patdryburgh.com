One more from Sunday’s hike. This is the second of the two snow caves at the top of the boulder field. We didn’t get up into this one because the scramble to get to it was a lot more difficult and we lacked the necessary experience and means to call for help if something went wrong. Instead, @andreasupernova went swimming in the stream fed in part by the melting of the cave.
.
But one day, one day we’ll get to it.
