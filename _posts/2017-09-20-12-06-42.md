Just bought a new notebook to replace the one I filled in Uganda. Went with the charcoal Confidant by Baron Fig because the light gray doesn't look very nice once it's dirty and worn. Would love to find a notebook with similar qualities to the Confidant (opens flat, dot grid, sturdy construction) with a more durable cover.
