<blockquote>
  There is the perception, particularly in American culture, that criticism and negativity go hand-in-hand. We understand well the idea of being in favor or something, or against something, but we don’t particularly understand how criticism fits into this dichotomy.

There is about a 1 in a billion chance that <a href="http://al3x.net/">Alex Payne</a> knows my name, let alone reads my blog. However, in his most recent post he seems to take me to task on my last post <a href="http://patdryburgh.com/post/271078863/why-start-with-the-negative">regarding criticism</a>.

After taking into consideration Alex’s remarks, I have realized I was a bit too quick to judge the motives of those who write criticizing others. What I wrote was a reaction to a <a href="http://twitter.com/titusferguson/status/6387489765">tweet</a> from Titus Ferguson, social media consultant at local <a href="http://www.rtraction.com/">rtraction</a>. His post stated his intention to write about the horrible job that local companies were doing with social media, an issue Titus is passionate about.

I should have been more clear about what I was hoping to communicate. Joshua Blankenship said <a href="http://soserio.us/creating-controversy/">recently</a>:

>Somewhere along the way on the web, a lot of designers and developers have abandoned common courtesy for condescending quips that drip with pride and ignorance.

It’s this arrogance I was commenting on. I was careful not to mention Titus’ name, because I know Titus personally and know that he is certainly not smug nor arrogant. His remark simply brought to mind <a href="http://dustincurtis.com/dear_american_airlines.html">recent</a> <a href="http://www.metalabdesign.com/zappos/">posts</a> I’ve read, as well as the whole client hate-fest happening over at <a href="http://clientsfromhell.tumblr.com/">Clients From Hell</a>.

All of this is to say that I agree with Alex that criticism does not necessarily equal negativity. However, as Alex writes, criticism must come from a passion for the target of the criticism, rather than simply a passion for pointing out flaws in others.
