Phil Coffman posted a <a href="http://www.philcoffman.com/blog/photography/iphone-photography/">fantastic post</a> explaining how he takes <a href="http://www.philcoffman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iPhone_photo_examples.jpg">some</a> of his <a href="http://www.philcoffman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/lighthouse_photo.jpg">fantastic</a> iPhone photographs.

I have tried <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=329800600&amp;mt=8">Best Camera</a> by Chase Jarvis, but found the app to be clunky and confusing. On numerous occasions the app has shut down with just a few filters in place. After reading Phil&#8217;s post, I quickly jumped at purchasing <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=327716311&amp;mt=8">TiltShift Generator</a> and downloading <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=318704758&amp;mt=8">Mill Colour</a> from the app store.

I thought I&#8217;d give a bit of a preview of what these apps can do, based on a simple photograph taken at the office.

Of all the photo manipulation apps I&#8217;ve tried on the iPhone, TiltShift Generator impresses me the most. It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s simple, and yet it has a ton of power hidden in its feature set. It doesn&#8217;t present every feature in a hodge-podge of icons and menus, but instead lets you explore a very simple navigation set to find its hidden potential. As <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2009/10/tweetie-20/">Shawn Blanc wrote</a> this week about iPhone apps:

>It is in this regard that software developers are not unlike writers. But instead of a plot they have a feature set, and instead of prose, a UI. The developer can lay out the whole of their feature set before the user with menus, sub-menus, and more. Or they can hide pieces of it hoping that each feature will be discovered, but knowing that perhaps they wonâ€™t.

With Phil&#8217;s recommendations, I&#8217;m excited to discover just what this little iPhone can do.
