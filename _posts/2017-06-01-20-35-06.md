I've been interested in microblogging since the early days of Twitter. After seeing my friend [Ben][bb] using the new [Micro.blog][mb] service created by [Manton Reece][mr], I became enthralled by the idea of adding a microblog ([back?][wm]) to my site. I'm still awaiting my invitation to the Micro.blog network, but you can see these micro-posts in my [JSON][json] and [RSS][rss] feeds.
