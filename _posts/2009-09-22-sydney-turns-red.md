This morning, dust cloaked the city of Sydney, Austraila, causing an unprecedented red haze. Apparently, with droughts affecting most of South Australia and winds picking up over the night, the dust was carried and blanketed the city as the sun&nbsp;rose. 

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/daniel.mutter">Daniel Mutter</a>, a buddy of mine living in Sydney right now,&nbsp;writes: 

>I woke up to discover all the windows in my house were glowing. I almost thought it was the end of the world, then as I gained consciousness I realized it was just the most amazing sky&nbsp;ever.

Daniel took some photographs of the city. These photographs are not edited in any way. The colour is&nbsp;real.
