Shortly after posting [my thoughts about last week's inaugural IndieWeb Meetup](https://patdryburgh.com/blog/vancouver-indieweb-meetup/), Boris let me know that he will be traveling through November and December and that [the responsibility for organizing the next meetup would fall to me](https://micro.blog/boris/954100).

I had such an amazing time at the first meet up that I was more than ok with that. And so without further ado, I'm pleased to announce the second IndieWeb Meetup Vancouver.
