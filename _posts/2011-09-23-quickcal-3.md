It was about 3 months ago when I was on the look out for a simple, fast way to add events to my iCal calendar. I wanted a simple app that would open with a keyboard shortcut, would let me enter the event using natural language, and would quickly get out of my way when the job was done.

I did some searching but came up short. I was beginning to wonder how I would find time to learn Objective C so I could create the app myself when my good friend [Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.com) pointed me to QuickCal.

QuickCal was everything I wanted. It was fast, it was simple, it used natural language to create events.

But damn, it was ugly.

I posted a tweet that same day to the effect of "I wish I could get in touch with the QuickCal app devs to discuss redesigning their app for them." I figured the tweet, like most of my tweets, would go unanswered. But, minutes later I was contacted by [Jim Boutcher](http://jimboutcher.com), the app's creator, and by the end of the day I was invited to join the QuickCal team as the new UI designer.

I began working on the app's design immediately, churning out mockup after mockup in Photoshop. I knew I wanted something simple, something that fit in with the OS X UI but didn't just use standard UI elements. I wanted *colour*.

After a few rounds of revisions, and even more rounds of refinements and changes, we finally settled on a UI that would become QuickCal 3.0.

I'm very proud to announce today that QuickCal 3.0 is [available on the Mac App store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/quickcal/id416581096). I'm also proud to announce the launch of the new [QuickCal site](http://quickcalapp.com), which I also had the pleasure of designing.

This was the first Mac application I've designed and I've learned a ton. We're already working on improvements for QuickCal 3.1 and I'm really excited about what's coming down the pipe.
