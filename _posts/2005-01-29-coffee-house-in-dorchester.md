We’re driving home from Dorchester right now. That’s so weird to say, as Dorchester has been my home for nearly 20 years, however now with me at school, I can now say that I am a resident of Kitchener. I suppose, however, that my heart will always be in Dorchester.

I just did a show at a coffeehouse. I was accompanied by my friend and yours, Mr. Tyler Martin on djambe. The show was great, so much talent coming from that little small town I grew up in. I have been so blessed to have a place where I can really grow my talents and showcase not only my music skills, but more-so my love for God.

The show had some great highlights. Sharon Bee had a great voice, accompanied by Jake something-or-other on guitar. They sounded great. Later on were a couple skits by James Cox and Brandon Cameron. They were priceless. Derek Drover, a singer/songwriter from Dorchester (also a youth pastor in Dorchester now) played a couple of great original songs that I loved. Sounded a bit like Bart Millard of Mercy Me. A personal favourite of mine, Todd Donald, did a couple of great songs he has written. Todd came up from Kitchener with us, and I had the great privilege of playing tambourine and singing back up vocals for his first song. It was fantastic.

My set with Tyler was great. We did “Catch Me” and “All I Need,” incidentally the two songs that are currently being played on the radio in Kansas! The crowd response was great, and it was great to rock out with the full Pat Dryburgh Band in attendance. Now, if only we can do a gig where all three of us play…

Thanks and props go out to Maria and Gord Hardcastle, as well as Charleanne their daughter, for putting on such a fantastic event. It was great to sit back with friends enjoying the amazing gifts that God has given all of us, as well as sharing the great things God is doing in our personal lives. Till next time Dorchester.
