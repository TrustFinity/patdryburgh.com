Wow. what a night! Last night was great. I played at EBC, debuting several of the songs I've been working on over the last couple of years. I think people enjoyed it! To read more about the concert and it's happenings, click here.

Also, some good news! My purevolume.com website, where you can download "All I Need" for free, has just recently hit 1000 hits! Click on the image to see the total as of today...
 
Thanks for all who have supported me over the last year. You are truly a blessing! God bless!
