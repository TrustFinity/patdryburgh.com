Are you heading to WWDC next week? Maybe you're not attending the conference, but you'll be in San Francisco? Are you a fan of John Siracusa's epic reviews of each OS X release? Are you a geek who could benefit from a bit of finger exercising?

Well then, have I got a role for you!

Next week, I'm heading down to WWDC. My primary concern is to connect with iOS developers in the hopes [we can hire one or two](http://perch.co/jobs). My secondary concern is to film the sequel to last year's "[Preparing for John Siracusa's Review of OS X Lion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhOG25fM8so)."

Last year's video was totally spur-of-the-moment, unplanned, and unpolished. This year, I'm going big.

And I need your help.

I'm looking for as many geeks as possible to dress up in gym shorts and a t-shirt, a head band and/or arm band, and meet me in Yerba Buena Gardens (just a block away from Moscone) at **12:45pm on Wednesday, June 13** (during WWDC's lunch break).

Those who participate will have lunch provided for them, and will be credited in the video.

To get involved, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:hello@patdryburgh.com?Subject=I <3 Siracusa">hello@patdryburgh.com</a> with the subject "I <3 Siracusa," and I'll forward you more details.

See you next week!
