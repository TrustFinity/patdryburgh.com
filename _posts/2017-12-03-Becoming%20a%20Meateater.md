I've never hunted before. My father took me fishing when I was young, but it was never a big part of my childhood. My focus was on organized sports and music. We did have a forest near our place where we would ride our little dirt bikes, but I didn't fully realize how fun hiking in the outdoors could be until I came back to BC in 2015.

Since returning to Vancouver, I've been spending more and more time outdoors which has made me contemplate getting into some fishing and hunting.

I recently came across hunter, writer, podcaster, and TV personality, Steven Rinella. Watching [his show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeatEater) inspired me to learn more about hunting and [his podcast](http://www.themeateater.com/podcasts/) inspired me to set some goals and put a plan in place to achieve them.

[His book](https://www.amazon.com/Meat-Eater-Adventures-American-Hunter/dp/0385529821), on the other hand, reminded me that I am lacking a lifetime of experience and knowledge. As excited as I am by the thought of one day finding and harvesting my own meat, I realize that it's a pursuit that may take many years to achieve.

Thankfully, I'm not in a rush. While I continue to develop my endurance in the mountains, my familiarity with the landscape, and the skills one requires to be qualified to hunt, I relish the fact that I am a complete beginner who doesn't really know what he doesn't know. For someone who loves to learn, it's a feeling worth recognizing and celebrating.
