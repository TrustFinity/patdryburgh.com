Hiked up the #hanesvalley boulder field yesterday with @andreasupernova. Took us 9 hours to get from #lynnheadwaters to the top of @grousemountain. The biggest lesson learned: make sure you check your water supply each time you stop at a water source. I had planned to at the last little creek before our ascent up the boulder field and forgot, forcing us to turn around about 10 min into our hike up.

Second biggest lesson learned: when you look up to see whatâ€™s ahead while hiking on a trail, be sure to stop and plant your feet first. I did not stop to see what was ahead and my foot caught on a root, causing me to trip. My stomach landed on a rock first, followed by my two front teeth. Miraculously, I wasnâ€™t injured all beyond a minor scrape on my rib cage. Wonâ€™t be making that mistake again (I hope!).

An incredible trip Iâ€™ve been dreaming of for a couple of years. Hands down the most difficult hike Iâ€™ve ever done. Canâ€™t wait to do it again next year ðŸ˜Š
