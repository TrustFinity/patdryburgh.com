Since arriving in Kampala, I've been looking to connect with others in the region who are using design to solve complex problems. For a while, the only evidence I'd found of such a community existing was a Facebook page for a group whose last post was announcing an event back in January. Not very promising.

I started looking up resources and suggestions for [running user tests in Uganda][utu] and found an article by Jacqui Watson of [Praekelt.org][pko] sharing the [lessons she learned performing user tests in Kabale, Uganda][put]. Praekelt.org doesn't have an office in Uganda so there's no opportunity to meet with them, but it was encouraging to see other teams practicing human-centred design in Uganda.

After a bit more searching, I came across an organization called [Design Without Borders][dwb] which appeared to operate exclusively in Uganda. Reading through their [case studies][dcs], I was floored by the work they were doing. I sent an email in the hopes of connecting with someone there and when I received a response, was pleasantly surprised to be invited to the grand opening of their new office in a new co-working space called [Design Hub Kampala][dhk].

The following Saturday, my partner, a colleague, and I found ourselves wandering through a beautifully renovated warehouse which now houses eight design-focused companies. The space was filled with glass walls, modern wooden desks, and presentations of work from each tenant.

I spoke briefly with one of Design Without Borders' design trainees who shared her story of joining the organization with a background in interior design and being trained in human-centred design. To learn of an organization in Kampala so focused on training a new generation of local designers was inspiring.

Design Hub Kampala appears to be an amazing addition to the community of Kampala. My hope is that in the short time I have left in Uganda I can make some connections with people in the space and begin the process of growing Ensibuuko's design team.
