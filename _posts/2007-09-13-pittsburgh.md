Wow. So, it seems I've pretty much left this thing by the wayside for the last 3 months. I can pretty much chalk it up to a very, very busy life that I've lead the for the last 90+ days. Here's a brief summary of what's been happening:

- On Canada Day, I was assaulted. I ended up with a fractured orbital bone, a broken bone to the right of my right eye, and a black eye that is still somewhat visible. Plastic surgery was almost needed, however thankfully was not in the end. They caught the guy who attacked me, and I will be going to court probably soon to testify.
- I spoke at a camp that I've been a counselor at for the last 6 years. It was an absolute blast. It was really great to have the opportunity to hone my communicating skills in a focused period of time. Hopefully in the next few months I will have more opportunities at the new church (more details about that to follow).
- Our church hosted around 30 bands during the first annual Freedom Fest. The turn out for the event was not as high as hoped for, however there is a good chance that it will be brought back next year.
- During July, I went through our church's first "360 Evaluation" process. The process involves questionnaires being filled out by those above me, those below me, and myself. The results were then tabulated and I was given a summary of what was said in the evaluations. A lot of it was great. Some was harder to hear. However, it was all very helpful in seeing what I need to improve and develop as a young leader. Over the last few months I have been working very hard at making sure I am diligent at making improvements in my leadership. So far I have heard some very positive feedback.
- I've realized over the last few weeks the importance of blogging once again, and hopefully over the next few months will continue to do so with regularity.

I mentioned above something about a "new church." Over the last few months Trinity has been working through the process of leaving the Presbyterian Church of Canada in order to continue with our vision for multi-site development in Ontario. By October 31st, our senior leadership, as well as our elders, will have resigned from the PCC. If the denomination decides to dissolve Trinity as a congregation, there is a possibility that we may be able to keep our building (or purchase it from the denomination). If not, there is a chance we may have to look at moving out of our building; a risk that many of us are excited about. My newest colleague Rich Birch and I will be traveling to Pittsburgh this weekend to check out one of the strategic partner's soft launch of their new site. I am looking forward to seeing how a custom audio/visual system could work in a portable situation as we look toward possibly moving from our current location.

I will be sure to take pictures and keep you updated!
