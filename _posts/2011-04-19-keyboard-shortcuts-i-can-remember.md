A totally pointless post about a totally pointless subject, because it's 10:11pm and I'm not quite tired enough to go to bed.

Here goes:

<table cellspacing="0" border="0">
    <tr>
        <td align="right">&#8984; + Space</td>
        <td>Trigger LaunchBar</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">&#8984; + \</td>
        <td>Show LaunchBar Clipboard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">&#8984; + &#8997; + Space</td>
        <td>Create Task in Things.app</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">&#8984; + &#8997; + CTRL + Space</td>
        <td>Create Task in Things.app and autofill note with selection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">CTRL + Space</td>
        <td>Show/Hide Twitterrific</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">&#8984; + &#8997; + &#8679; + D</td>
        <td>Shorten selected link in Droplr</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">&#8984; + &#8997; + CTRL + L</td>
        <td>Open vertical split in Coda</td>
    </tr>
</table>

That's it. Seven keyboard shortcuts. There are quite a few others that serve multiple purposes depending on what app you're in (&#8984; + &#8997; + P opens the "Document Settings" in InDesign and Illustrator), and there are the other obvious ones that are system wide (&#8984; + Q, &#8984; + W, &#8984; + S, &#8984; + N).

The command that is most ingrained in my muscle memory is CTRL + Space to show/hide Twitterrific. I find myself hitting this combination even when Twitterrific is closed. I often wonder how I could capture the number of times I hit that shortcut in a day, to see how often I'm looking to escape from whatever I'm doing to participate in the Statusphere.

I can't do it in my current state of mind, but I would love to work out exactly how many keyboard shortcuts I know. I imagine I use upwards of a couple dozen through the day without thinking of them. The ones listed here are simply the ones I hold dearest to my fingertips.
