I've been designing and building on the web for over 10 years. From a music playlist generator powered by tweets to an accounting platform for micro-financing institutions in sub-Saharan Africa, my breadth of experience brings fresh thinking to every project.

I've worked with some great teams and clients including [Grooveshark][gs], [Adobe][ad], [Fusion Ads][fa], [CocoaTech][cct], [QuickCal][qc], Thorel Woodworking, [Ethical Coffee Chain][ecc], UpThemes, [Ongo][ongo], [Perch][perch], [Agent Inbox][ai], [Brewhouse][bh], [Steamclock][sc], [Arc'teryx][arc], [Viral Foundry][vf], [Finstripe][fs], [Blanc Media][bm], [Platero Visual][pv], [Rye&nbsp;51][r5], [Stantec][st], and [Ensibuuko][en].

My work has been featured in Beautiful Pixels, TechCrunch, Gigaom, VentureBeat, and the iOS App Store.

Originally from London, Ontario, I now live in Vancouver, British Columbia with my partner Andrea and a few plants. In my free time I write and record music, [take photos](http://instagram.com/patdryburgh), and explore the beautiful province I now call home.

## Colophon

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github](https://pages.github.com). Freight and Freight Sans are served by [Typekit](http://typekit.com). The illustration of me is by [Courtney Make](https://twitter.com/courtneymake?lang=en).

Growing up, I enjoyed watching directors' commentaries of my favourite movies. I love learning how people do what they do and think what they think. In web design and development, the closest comparison to a director's commentary is getting to see the actual code someone wrote to produce a site. You can see how this site is made by viewing the public repo on [Github][gb].
