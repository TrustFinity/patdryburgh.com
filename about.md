I found my love for [design](/design) back in the age of table-based layouts, font tags, and spacer GIFs. I've published [my writing](http://patdryburgh.com) on the internet on-and-off for the past decade. My work has been featured in Beautiful Pixels, TechCrunch, Gigaom, VentureBeat, and the iOS App Store.

<a href="/now/">Currently</a>, I am <a href="/blog/designing-in-uganda">leading product and service design</a> for microfinancing startup <a href="http://ensibuuko.com">Ensibuuko</a> in Kampala, Uganda.

In my free time I write and record music, [take photos](http://instagram.com/patdryburgh), and explore the beautiful province of British Columbia.
