I found my love for [design]({{ '/design/' | absolute_url }}) back in the age of table-based layouts, font tags, and spacer GIFs. I've published [my writing]({{ '/blog/' | absolute_url }}) on the internet on-and-off for the past 13 years. My design work has been featured in Beautiful Pixels, TechCrunch, Gigaom, VentureBeat, and the iOS App Store.

[Currently]({{ '/now/' | absolute_url }}), I am [leading product and service design]({{ '/blog/designing-in-uganda' | absolute_url }}) for microfinancing startup [Ensibuuko](http://ensibuuko.com) in Kampala, Uganda.

In my free time I write and record music, [take photos](http://instagram.com/patdryburgh), and explore the beautiful province of British Columbia.
