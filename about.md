I found my love for [design](/design) back in the age of table-based layouts, font tags, and spacer GIFs. I've published [my writing](/blog) on the internet on-and-off for the past decade. My work has been featured in Beautiful Pixels, TechCrunch, Gigaom, VentureBeat, and the iOS App Store.

In my free time I write and record music, take photos, and explore the beautiful province of British Columbia.
