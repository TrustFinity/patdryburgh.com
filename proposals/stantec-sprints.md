## Introduction

The goal of this proposal is to provide an overview of the design process we will utilize throughout the project, as well as the <a href="#estimate">estimated cost</a> associated with the project. Any questions or concerns raised through reading this proposal may be brought directly to my attention <a href="mailto:hello@patdryburgh.com">via email</a> or by calling <a href="tel:1-226-377-6754">1-226-377-6754</a>.

## Project Overview

Stantec provides professional consulting services in planning, engineering, architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, surveying, environmental sciences, project management, and project economics for infrastructure and facilities projects. Our aim is to design, prototype, and test a series of prototypes for various internal purposes in order to gain a deeper understanding of the motivations and needs of employees and teams working together at Stantec.

## Sprint Overview

This project proposal presents the 5 phases of a one-week product design sprint. Through this process, we will work to understand the problem at hand, identify our assumptions about the product and customers, explore as many potential solutions as possible, prototype the best ideas, and test the prototype with real customers. Our objective is to complete two design sprints per project.

### Projects

- Stream
- Eco
- MobileForms
- Expertise
- Meet

### Phase 1: Discovery

Pat will meet with Stantec's project leads to clarify the problem to be solved and establish business objectives and key performance indicators for the project. The team will also identify the customers' motivations and jobs to be done, and will establish a plan to achieve our objectives. A set of assumptions will be identified and recorded for reference during the user tests.

Sprints for projects which have already had prototypes developed for them (Eco, Mobile Forms, Expertise, Meet) will begin by discussing the state of the prototype with the project lead to identify assumptions to be tested first. A second discussion will follow to determine jobs to be done for the next prototype to be tested.

#### Deliverables

- Key performance indicators
- Initial list of jobs to be done

### Phase 2: User Interviews

Project leads will be responsible for scheduling 5 30-minute interviews on the first day of their project's sprint. Pat will perform interviews with the assistance of the Jr designer. A discussion of the motivations and needs of our users will refine our list of jobs to be done.

#### Deliverables

- Audio recordings of user interviews
- Notes compiled from user interviews
- Refined list of jobs to be done

### Phase 3: Brainstorming, User Flows, and Storyboarding

The design team will begin mind mapping the various areas of the product and use these as the basis for initial user flows. In turn, the user flows will be translated into sketched storyboards. These storyboards are intended to try as many ideas as quickly as possible in order to determine an agreeable approach to the design of these pages prior to committing to a particular path of execution.

While multiple possible directions will be investigated during this phase, Pat reserves the right to only present the storyboards that best reflect the project’s objectives.

#### Deliverables

- User flow
- Sketches
- Storyboard

### Phase 4: Prototype

By adopting a philosophy of &ldquo;fake it 'til you make it&rdquo;, Pat will turn our storyboard into a prototype that will allow us to test our ideas and assumptions and fill any remaining knowledge gaps. We'll create our prototype with a tool that fits our needs, time constraints, and learning goals with the understanding that our ultimate goal is to validate our ideas and capture our customers' reactions. We'll also use this time to confirm our testing schedule, review the prototype, and write an interview script.

#### Deliverables

- Prototype

### Phase 5: Test

Through interviewing potential users and capturing their reaction to our prototype, we can validate our ideas and assumptions and gain invaluable insight into our riskiest knowledge gaps and what problems remain. With this knowledge, we can plan what to do next with confidence.

#### Deliverables

- Video recordings of user tests
- Notes from user tests
- User profile matrix in [Airtable](https://airtable.com)
- Plan for next steps

### Payment Schedule
An initial retainer payment of 50% of the total estimated cost of the project is due upon signing the final agreement. The remaining cost of the project will be due at the end of the project, before final deliverables are handed off to the client. Full terms of agreement for this project can be viewed at the bottom of this document.
