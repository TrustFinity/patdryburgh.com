## Introduction

The goal of this proposal is to provide an overview of the design process we will utilize throughout the project, as well as the <a href="#estimate">estimated cost</a> associated with the project. Any questions or concerns raised through reading this proposal may be brought directly to Pat’s attention <a href="mailto:hello@patdryburgh.com">via email</a> or by calling <a href="tel:1-226-377-6754">1-226-377-6754</a>.

## Project Overview

Stantec provides professional consulting services in planning, engineering, architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, surveying, environmental sciences, project management, and project economics for infrastructure and facilities projects. Our aim is to design a prototype for a meeting planner to be used by executive level leaders and executive administrators.

## Production Process

This project proposal has broken the project into phases, so that progress can be clearly seen by the client as it happens, and so that continual feedback from the client can strengthen the results of the final product.

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery

Pat will meet with project leads Aubrey Tucker and Kim Glauber to clarify the problem to be solved and establish business objectives and key performance indicators for the project. The team will also identify the customers' motivations and jobs to be done, and will establish a plan to achieve our objectives.

### Phase 2: User Interviews

Interviews with up to 5 of each of our identified user types will give us further insight into the motivations and needs of our users. Building on the interviews previously completed by Boris Mann, Pat will interview potential users to understand the contexts in which the product would be used and the jobs to be done.

### Phase 3: Brainstorming, User Flows, and Storyboarding

Pat will begin mind mapping the various areas of the product and use these as the basis for initial user flows. In turn, the user flows will be translated into sketched storyboards. These storyboards are intended to try as many ideas as quickly as possible in order to determine an agreeable approach to the design of these pages prior to committing to a particular path of execution.

While multiple possible directions will be investigated during this phase, Pat reserves the right to only present the storyboards that best reflect the project’s objectives.

### Phase 4: Prototype

By adopting a philosophy of &ldquo;fake it 'til you make it&rdquo;, Pat will turn our storyboard into a prototype that will allow us to test our ideas and assumptions and fill any remaining knowledge gaps. We'll create our prototype with a tool that fits our needs, time constraints, and learning goals with the understanding that our ultimate goal is to validate our ideas and capture our customers' reactions. We'll also use this time to confirm our testing schedule, review the prototype, and write an interview script.

### Phase 5: Test

Through interviewing potential users and capturing their reaction to our prototype, we can validate our ideas and assumptions and gain invaluable insight into our riskiest knowledge gaps and what problems remain. With this knowledge, we can plan what to do next with confidence.

The remaining cost of the project will be due at the end of the project, before final deliverables are handed off to the client. Full terms of agreement for this project can be viewed at the bottom of this document.

## Agreement

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This document details the terms and conditions for the Design &amp; Prototyping project for Stantec as outlined in Proposal v1.0. Discussed here are the term, payment schedule, and intellectual rights to project files and produced work.

### 2. AUTHORIZATION

This contract represents an agreement between Stantec (the client) and Pat Dryburgh (the service provider).
