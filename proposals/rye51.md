## Introduction

The goal of this proposal is to provide an overview of the process of designing and building a Shopify theme for Rye 51, as well as an estimation of the cost associated with the project. Any questions or concerns raised through reading this proposal may be brought directly to Pat’s attention <a href="mailto:hello@patdryburgh.com">via email</a> or by calling <a href="tel:1-226-377-6754">1-226-377-6754</a>.

This proposal is valid for 7 days from the date of delivery.

## Project Overview

Rye 51 is a luxury brand and retailer of men's dry goods and apparel. The aim of this project is to design a new Shopify theme for the Rye 51 online store that prioritizes storytelling, editorial photography, and video elements.

## Production Process

This project proposal has broken the project into phases, so that progress can be clearly seen by the client as it happens, and so that continual feedback from the client can strengthen the results of the final product.

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery

Pat will meet over Skype with the product owner, in-house design and photography team, and other key stakeholders to clarify the problem to be solved and establish business objectives and key performance indicators for the project. The team will also identify the customers' motivations and jobs to be done, and will establish a plan to achieve our objectives.

### Phase 2: Sketching & Brainstorming

Pat will begin sketching layouts for the home page, product pages, collection pages, and other ancillary pages. These sketches are intended to try as many ideas as quickly as possible in order to determine an agreeable approach to the design of these pages prior to committing to a particular path.

While multiple possible directions will be investigated during this phase, Pat reserves the right to only present solutions that best reflect the project’s objectives.

- Develop the information architecture for the following page types:
  1. Home Page
  2. Product Pages
  3. Category Pages
  4. Ancillary Pages

### Phase 3: Responsive Design & Development

Working closely with the product owner, Pat will take the content provided by the product owner and begin designing and developing a responsive Shopify theme. As part of this process, a pattern library will be created in order to design reusable components for the site.

All design work will be completed directly in the browser using standards-compliant HTML &amp; CSS, rather than converting mockups designed in Photoshop into code further down the road. The site’s front-end will be built using HTML5, CSS3, responsive design methodologies, progressive enhancement for styling, and Javascript and jQuery for any interactive elements.
