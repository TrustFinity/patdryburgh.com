## Introduction

The goal of this proposal is to provide an overview of the design sprint process, as well as the <a href="#estimate">estimated cost</a> associated with the project. Any questions or concerns raised through reading this proposal may be brought directly to Pat’s attention <a href="mailto:hello@patdryburgh.com">via email</a> or by calling <a href="tel:1-226-377-6754">1-226-377-6754</a>.

## Project Overview

Nimble is a project management and performance measurement platform built for the team at iQmetrix. The team responsible for Nimble has identified a need for a product design sprint and additional prototyping in order to determine a path toward bringing Nimble to a wider market.

## Design Sprint Process

Design Sprints are an opportunity for teams to share ideas and collaboratively solve big problems in a matter of days. Teams made up of product owners and managers, designers, developers, sales and marketing people, and other interested stakeholders follow a 5-phase process that helps them understand the problem at hand, explore as many potential solutions as possible, prototype the best ideas, and validate our ideas with real customers before committing a single line of code.

These 5 phases &mdash; [Understand](#understand), [Diverge](#diverge), [Converge](#converge), [Prototype](#prototype), and [Test](#test) &mdash; take the current best practices in business strategy, design thinking, behavioral science, and innovation and allow teams to cut through the bullshit and validate their ideas with real human beings quickly and cost-effectively.

### Understand

We begin the sprint by sharing knowledge, understanding the problem, mapping our customers' journey, and establishing our goals for the sprint. Assumptions and knowledge gaps are identified and captured here and throughout the sprint and serve as the basis of our testing. Participants are encouraged to ask questions and share ideas so that we can come to a shared understanding of who our customer is and what problem we are hoping to solve for them.

### Diverge

The team explores as many potential solutions to the problem as possible and insights are realized through the consideration of radically different approaches to solving the problem. By building upon each participants' ideas and evaluating the differentiation between them, we are able to more quickly generate unique solutions to our customers' problem.

### Converge

Not all of the ideas generated over the previous two days can or should be tested. By evaluating and eliminating so many ideas, we can decide which will have the best chance of solving our customers' problem and be confident in our choices. By the end of the converge phase, the team will have created a complete storyboard that illustrates step-by-step the plan for our prototype.

### Prototype

By adopting a philosophy of &ldquo;fake it 'til you make it&rdquo;, the team will turn our storyboard into a prototype that will allow us to test our ideas and assumptions and fill any remaining knowledge gaps. We'll create our prototype with a tool that fits our needs, time constraints, and learning goals with the understanding that our ultimate goal is to validate our ideas and capture our customers' reactions. We'll also use this time to confirm our testing schedule, review the prototype, and write an interview script.

### Test

Through interviewing existing or potential customers and capturing their reaction to our prototype, we can validate our ideas and assumptions and gain invaluable insight into our riskiest knowledge gaps and what problems remain. With this knowledge, we can plan what to do next with confidence.

Description                               | Hours   | Rate    | Cost
:---------------------------------------- | ------: | ------: | ----------: |
Design Sprint Prep                        | 8       | $125    | $1,000      |
Design Sprint                             | 40      | $125    | $5,000      |
Additional Design & Prototyping           | 40      | $125    | $5,000      |
**Total**                                 | **88**  |         | **$11,000** |

### Payment Schedule
An initial retainer payment of 50% of the total estimated cost of the project is due upon signing the final agreement. The remaining cost of the project will be due at the end of the project, before final deliverables are handed off to the client. Full terms of agreement for this project can be viewed at the bottom of this document.

## Agreement

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This document details the terms and conditions for the Design Sprint and Prototyping project for iQMetrix. as outlined in Proposal v1.0. Discussed here are the term, payment schedule, and intellectual rights to project files and produced work.

### 2. AUTHORIZATION

This contract represents an agreement between iQmetrix (the client) and Pat Dryburgh (the service provider). Services will be delivered by the service provider according to the term and conditions detailed below. The service provider will be in direct contact with Chris Nicoll, who will provide feedback and approval. By signing this document all parties agree to the legitimacy of the project.

### 3. PAYMENT OF FEES

50% of the total estimated cost shall be paid as a retainer and is due upon signing this agreement. This retainer is non-refundable. The remaining payment will be due at the completion of the project. The service provider reserves the right to retain final deliverables until the final payment has been made.

The first 50% payment shall be in the amount of **$5,500 CAD** and the final payment will be for the remainder of actual incurred costs.

### 4. PROPOSED TIMELINE

This project timeline has been established to ensure both parties know when certain deliverables are due.

Day           | Milestone
:------------ | :-------------
0             | Signed Agreement and Retainer Cheque Received
              | Discovery discussion with Client (30 min phone call)
              | Purchase of design sprint supplies
1–5           | Design Sprint
6–10          | Additional Prototypes

<small><em>Timeline expressed in business days.</em></small>

Should the client fail to meet their deadlines for feedback and approval, the service provider reserves the right to rearrange the schedule. Failure on the client’s part to meet deadlines may result in a delay of the completion of the project, resulting in the project not meeting its final deadline. Once a deadline has been missed, a reassessment will be made of the entire schedule, with both parties agreeing to the changes.

### 5. PROJECT TERMINATION FEES

Should the client cease communication for a period of more than 5 business days during this project, the service provider reserves the right to terminate the project, and the client shall pay the client the greater of 25% of the estimated cost of the project or the total costs incurred minus the initial retainer. Should the client choose to terminate the project before the project is completed the client shall pay the client the greater of 25% of the estimated cost of the project or the total costs incurred minus the initial retainer.

### 6. MANAGEMENT

#### 6.1 UPDATES

All updates to the product will be performed by the client. Any layout or programming changes made by the service provider following project completion, or apart from the project outline, will be billed accordingly.

#### 6.2 CONTENT PRIOR TO LAUNCH

Content includes, but is not limited to, written copy and/or imagery that the client is required to provide in order for the project to proceed. The client must provide content as detailed in the Project Overview to the service provider in a timely manner. Unless it is explicitly stated in the Project Overview section of this agreement that the service provider will be providing content, the service provider is not obligated to provide content for the project.

The designation that the project is complete will be at the discretion of the service provider.

### 7. PROJECT RIGHTS

#### 7.1 DESIGN RIGHTS

The rights to use the completed project are given entirely to the client upon receipt of the final payment as discussed in Section 3 of this agreement. The service provider retains the rights to use non-confidential aspects of the completed project in portfolio and promotional pieces. Source files will not be provided to the client.

#### 7.2 RIGHTS TO IMAGERY AND TYPOGRAPHY
