subtitle: I can't wait to start working with you.
---


## Introduction

The goal of this proposal is to provide an overview of the process of designing the Focus Course blog, as well as the estimated cost associated with the project. Any questions or concerns raised through reading this proposal may be brought directly to Pat’s attention <a href="mailto:hello@patdryburgh.com">via email</a> or by calling <a href="tel:1-226-377-6754">1-226-377-6754</a>.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Focus Course is a 40-day curriculum aimed at helping people find focus in their life and work. The aim of this project is to design a blog in order to introduce people to the Focus Course suite of products and encourage them to sign up for The Focus Life newsletter.

## PRODUCTION PROCESS

This project proposal has broken the project into phases, so that progress can be clearly seen by the client as it happens, and so that continual feedback from the client can strengthen the results of the final product.

### Phase 1: Sketching & Brainstorming

Pat will begin the design process by sketching layouts for the article page, category page, and the blog's home page. These sketches are intended to try as many ideas as quickly as possible in order to determine an agreeable approach to the design of these pages prior to committing to a particular path.

1. Develop the information architecture for the following page types:
  a. Article page
  b. Category page
  c. Blog home page
2. Sketch responsive layouts for reusable lead magnet component;

#### Phase 1 Milestones:*

Day           | Milestone
:------------ | :-------------
1             | Signed Agreement and Retainer Cheque Received
              | Discovery discussion with Client (30 min phone call)
              | Access to analytic software granted to Designer
2             | Written recommendations delivered to client
              | Discussion with client regarding recommendations, if needed
              | Access to analytic software granted to Designer

<small>*Timeline expressed in business days.</small>

### Phase 2: Discovery, Research, Visual Inventory

Pat will begin researching Tools &amp; Toys' competitors, as well as publications which don't directly compete with T&amp;T, resulting in a visual inventory outlining potential visual paths the design of the site can take. Upon delivery of the visual inventory document, a discussion will take place to decide which direction best suits the project. Technical requirements will also be discussed during this meeting.

#### Phase 2 Milestones:

Day           | Milestone
:------------ | :-------------
3             | Visual Inventory delivered to Client
              | Visual Inventory discussion between Designer and Client

### Phase 3: Style Tiles &amp; Content Delivery

With the project goals, audience, visual direction, and technical requirements established, Pat will begin creating Style Tiles, which are a representation of the visual elements to be used throughout the design. This includes but is not limited to: setting the base typography, choosing a colour scheme, designing buttons and form elements, and establishing a consistent visual language.

During this phase, it will be most helpful to have real content with which to design. An export of the WordPress database along with the theme and plugin list for the current Tools &amp; Toys site would be ideal.

#### Phase 3 Milestones:

Day           | Milestone
:------------ | :-------------
4             | Content and site theme delivered by Client
              | Initial Style Tiles delivered to Client
5             | Client feedback required for Style Tiles
              | Revised Style Tiles delivered to Client (if necessary)
6             | Client approval required for Style Tiles


### Phase 4: Front-End Design &amp; Development

All design work will be completed directly in the browser using standards-compliant HTML &amp; CSS, rather than converting mockups designed in Photoshop into code further down the road. The site’s front-end will be built using HTML5, CSS3, responsive design methodologies, progressive enhancement for styling, and Javascript and jQuery for any interactive elements.

In order to ensure that costs remain as minimal as possible, while also benefiting from the work previously completed on the site, all design and development will be based off of the current site's theme and content. This will ensure that all custom field and post types are accounted for and that none of the beneficial current features are lost in the transition.

Any design directions taken during this stage will be based on the visual direction established during the Style Tile phase. While multiple possible directions will be investigated during this phase, Pat reserves the right to only present the designs that best reflect the project’s goals. The client will be afforded up to two rounds of revisions during this phase. If the client requires more than two rounds of revisions during the design phase, additional costs will be added to the cost of the project, as outlined in the <a href="#estimate">estimate portion</a> of this proposal.
