# Hello, World

This is my blog. I mean, not [the one you can read][pd]. This is what makes [the one you can read][pd]. I'm making it with the help of Jekyll, a static site generator. [The one you can read][pd] is hosted on Github pages and is my playground for learning how to make things for the web.
