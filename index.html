    <h2>How can I help?</h2>

    <p>
      I love discussing interesting projects of all types, but there are specific areas where I can help you achieve your business objectives and create value for your business and your customers.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Prototyping your awesome new idea.</h3> 
        Need to validate your ideas before raising your next round of funding? Or perhaps your company already has an existing product but doesn't have the internal resources to explore new ideas and opportunities. I've worked with startups and established businesses looking to test their ideas and assumptions through design sprints, prototyping, and building minimum viable products.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Designing &amp; developing awesome websites and apps.</h3>
        With over 10 years of experience working with companies both large and small, I can help you bring your idea from conception to launch. I am able to lead teams of designers and developers to help you reach your business objectives while creating an awesome experience for your customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Naming your new business or product.</h3>
        Coming up with the right name for your brand requires an equal mix of creative and strategic thinking. I can help you brainstorm a list of names or objectively evaluate an existing list of options to help you find the right name for your brand.
      </li>
    </ul>
