On Stage's previous website struggled to keep up with the growing demands of a growing dance studio. I was hired to bring the groove from the dance floor to the web. Once a content strategy had been developed, a fresh website with bold photography and beautiful type was created, highlighting not only what happens in the studio, but also what happens in the community.

The site was built on WordPress so the staff at On Stage Dance could update the site themselves. With new features like online photo-editing, custom post types, and a beautiful new dashboard, WordPress was the perfect solution for this project. The site has been designed using CSS media queries, which help the site look at home in either a desktop or mobile browsing experience.
