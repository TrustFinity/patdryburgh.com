Cocoatech is a Mac development company, responsible for the fantastic file browser Path Finder.

In 2011, Cocoatech was set to release Path Finder 6 and wanted to improve their web presence to better promote the product and further establish themselves as a world-class development company within the Mac community. The single-page site was created to market Path Finder 6, while also establishing a design strategy and style the company has continued to use and evolve to this day.
