I’m kind of in this zone right now where I just feel like my time at Trinity/Connexus didn’t even happen. I’m not sure why it is. I had a lot of great times, and learned a lot. But, it seems like none of it made a difference, you know? 

I was reading Casey Ross’ blog earlier today. Casey was the lead pastor of Catalyst Church for 2 years. During his time he saw a lot of exciting things happen, and yet struggled with a lot as well, especially with finances (which eventually led to the end of Catalyst). 

Over the last couple of months I’ve been home, I’ve been very happy to have stayed in contact with some of the people I worked with during my time up there. Some I talk to occasionally, others I talk to almost every day. I don’t want to sound ungrateful, or selfish, but I am somewhat surprised that there are a larger number of people who haven’t attempted to make contact with me since I’ve left. Even for the month I was still in Barrie after my time was up at Connexus, I had a few people contact me, and really enjoyed getting to chat and share with those people. However, out of a music team of 45 people, and a church of over 900 that I served for a year, I guess I’m just a bit surprised how unappreciated I feel. 

So, I just want to let those who I have been able to keep in contact with how grateful and thankful I am that you are my friends. For those who I know I still need to contact but haven’t had the opportunity to after you’ve reached out to me, I apologize, and I promise that in the next week or two I will. For those who may happen to read this who haven’t made contact yet, please don’t feel like the door is closed.

I’m craving reconciliation right now. I guess I just don’t know where to begin.
