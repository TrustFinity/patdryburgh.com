Wow, what a weekend! We had a great time playing at London YFC on Friday. The journal for this event will probably not be up until next weekend, but make sure you check the forums to meet and greet with those who were there.

Also, we've been added to the Blank Blue Sky tour this August. We're opening the show on Aug 19 in Guelph, and other dates to join the BBS are in the works. Stay tuned for more details.

Also, please continue praying for the CD. We've decided we need to put a deadline on this thing, so we're aiming for an October 20 release. We'll be planning a CD release show with some good friends of ours for a Kitchener outing. Details to follow.

Thanks so much for comin' by. God bless!
