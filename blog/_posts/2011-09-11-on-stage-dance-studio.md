This past weekend marked the launch of a site I have been working on for some time now. [On Stage Dance Studio](http://onstagedance.ca)—the top dance studio in Stratford, Ontario—hired me to redesign their site and build it so they could update the content themselves.

I've been reading a lot about responsive web design lately, having launched the responsive version of my own site back in July. I've learned a lot since then. For this particular project, I made sure to design for "mobile first," to ensure that mobile browsers wouldn't load unnecessary images and other media.

This project was a lot of fun and I'm really proud of how it turned out. Thanks to Meghan and the amazing people at On Stage Dance for everything.
