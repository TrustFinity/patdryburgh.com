I got into my office today, and immediately received a phone call to come down to the office. Immediately I'm thinking something bad has happened, or that something has gone wrong.

Turns out, I had received a package which contained my passport. 11 business days. They said it would be 15. I am amazed!

Praise God! I didn't want to have to worry about it as we were quickly approaching the Orange conference in Atlanta!
