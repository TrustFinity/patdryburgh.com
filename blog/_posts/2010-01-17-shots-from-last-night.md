My band, [Boss Rebel](http://myspace.com/bossrebel), had the honour of opening for Toronto's illScarlett last night at Norma Jean's in London. The show was sold out, and it was a party from start to finish.

Here are some shots I took of my friends and the other bands. Check out the rest at [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/patdryburgh).

This is the first concert I have shot with my new D90 and I learned a lot from the experience. Definitely tough to find a balance between nice, artistic lighting, capturing the action, and getting angles that don't seem as though I'm standing in the same spot the whole show.

The 50mm prime lens was a little limiting, as the lead guitarist was way on the other side of the stage, while the bass player was right in front of me. I'd love to know what lens those with more experience would recommend.
