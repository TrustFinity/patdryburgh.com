I'm heading to Cupertino later this week, and will be in the Bay Area until the end of the month. I'm working with a client down there and also plan on checking out the area while I'm there.

I will be in San Francisco for this year's Macworld Expo. While I don't plan on attending the event itself, I'm really hoping to meet up with some friends who I know are also making the trek to San Francisco for the event.

If you're in the area over the next few weeks and would like to grab a coffee, please <a href="mailto:hello@patdryburgh.com">shoot me an email</a> and we will set something up. And, if you're a They Might Be Giants and/or Jonathan Coulton fan, maybe you'd like to join me for [their show in Santa Cruz on January 28](http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=3988695).
