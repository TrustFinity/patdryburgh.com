At what point have you checked your email, your Facebook, your Twitter feed, your RSS subscriptions, browsed YouTube, Vimeo, Digg, Reddit, checked your email, checked your iPhone for text messages, scanned through your todo list, refreshed your Twitter feed, reblogged that ironic photo, checked your email, read pages and pages of Daring Fireball, complained that the iPad isn’t everything you dreamed of, read your RSS feed for other people complaining about the same thing, scanned your todo list again, and checked your email enough times before you actually decide to do something productive?

I’m almost there.
