Last April, my friend [Carly Thomas][1] invited violinist Noah Battaglia and myself to join her for a live-on-the-floor music video our friend [Edward][2] was filming. The song, *[I'll Find an Ocean][3]*, just made the first cut in local radio station [98.1 Free FM's &ldquo;Under the Covers&rdquo; songwriters' contest][4], bringing Carly one step away from a huge $4000 recording package prize.

The voting system is annoying (requiring voters to create a new account on their WordPress-built user management system), but if you would be so kind as to [take the time to vote for us][4], I would really appreciate it.
