I linked to [David Redding](http://www.davidreddingphoto.com/) last week when he featured me in his photo series, [The Real London](http://thereallondon.tumblr.com/post/11931164851/pat-dryburgh-designer-musician-film-maker). David is a craftsman. He is able to take a scene which most people walk right by on a daily basis and turn it into a magical location. He did this on our photo shoot last week. Below are the results of his craft.

Thank you, David, for not only taking some fantastic portraits, but for also showing me what true confidence looks like from the other side of the lens.
