Striking out on my own last year, one of my key motivations was to have the freedom to travel. I wanted to be able to hop in my car and go anywhere, anytime.

Well, that plan hasn't exactly panned out. Sure, I've gone on a few trips—the [trip to Palo Alto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we7vYyhFYhQ) for a job interview that didn't work out, a trip to [Montréal](http://patdryburgh.com/blog/montreal-easter-2010/) to see my brother, and numerous trips to Toronto to hang with my friend [Avery](http://averyedison.com)—but nothing like the cross-continent exploring I had envisioned as I left my old office that wonderful May afternoon.

All that is about to change as I have a number of trips lined up for the coming months, the first of which is to the wonderful city of New York, New York to attend this year's [Brooklyn Beta](http://brooklynbeta.org/2011).

I, like thousands of other designers and developers, blinked at exactly 12 noon the day the Brooklyn Beta tickets went on sale and therefore missed my opportunity to purchase a ticket. Undeterred, I began making plans with my designer friend [Mike Precious](http://mikeprecious.com) to head to Brooklyn anyway to hob nob and rub shoulders with those who would be attending the conference.

Then, last week I got a surprising email from one [Christian Ross](http://www.christianross.net/)—yes, [that Christian Ross](http://dribbble.com/shots/271497-Flip-Clock-Redux?list=following#comment-682911)—offering me his ticket to the event. To say I was blown away by his generosity is an understatement. To say he should be expecting a year's subscription to a certain colourful notebook brand pretty soon is a factual statement.<a href="#fn0001"><sup>1</sup></a>

So, now I'm going to [Brooklyn Beta](http://brooklynbeta.org/2011), my first ever web design/development conference. Ever. And man, I'm nervous.

You see, some of the people listed as attendees are people I've always believed to be no larger than a 48&#215;48px. But before me they will stand, some of the greats of our industry. Andy McMillan, organizer of [Build](http://2011.buildconf.com/) and publisher of [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com/); Brian Hoff, writer at [The Design Cubicle](http://www.thedesigncubicle.com/); [Cameron Moll](http://cameronmoll.com/), whose job titles would take a post of its own; [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/), creator of Dribbble after he basically invented CSS, right?; [Dan Mall](http://www.danielmall.com/), brilliant designer at Big Spaceship; [Dave Rupert](http://daverupert.com) and [Trent Walton](http://trentwalton.com) of [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com), one of my favourite web shops today; I'm not even half way through the list and I'm going nuts wrapping my head around the people attending this event, not to mention [other friends](http://irontoiron.com) who are planning to make the trek to meet up.

Needless to say, there are a ton of people I have admired for a long time, people who have taught me the knowledge and skills I now make a living with, who for a few short days will be within glancing distance.

I'm excited. I'm nervous. I really need to go buy some more oxford shirts and chinos or something. Damnit, I wish I had more time to buy some Threadless tees.

See you in October, New York.
