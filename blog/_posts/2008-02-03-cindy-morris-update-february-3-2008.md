I got this in my inbox tonightâ€¦ I am so amazed.

>(Cindy) has been awake and saw all her kids today. She has 12-15hrs of facial reconstructive surgery tomorrow. She has been communicating by mouthing words to the kids. Now that she is more alert she is in more pain. Really smiling each time she sees the kids and very thankful that they are ok. Will update after surgery which may not be until late tomorrow

Amazing.
