It is my opinion that great design is born of passion. It is also my opinion that extended education absent of real-world experience is the surest way to squelch that passion. And so, it was with great anticipation that several months ago, I found myself at the showcase for Red Academy’s first UX Design cohort.

Unlike a standard 4-year undergraduate program, [Red](https://www.redacademy.com) offers a 3-month intensive program built around the idea that learning happens best when applied to real-world experience. Red students learn the fundamentals of user research, rapid iteration, prototyping, and testing while working with real clients, developing client-consultant relationship skills I’ve yet to observe in an undergrad.

I sat amongst the showcase audience absorbing what was being presented. There was a mobile app for touring local craft breweries, a mobile social network for entrepreneurs to post short-term jobs for students, a dinner reservation booking app, and a few website redesigns. The students shared their research techniques, various iterations of their work, and the final deliverable. A great deal of each presentation was spent on _how_ users would accomplish the task at hand.

For each screen in each presentation, students gave detailed explanations for how users were expected to use their designs. Users can tap on the Facebook button to log into Facebook. Users can tap on this button to save a brewery to a list. Users can use coupons when dining out with friends or clients.

Meanwhile, the words of [Frank Chimero](http://shapeofdesignbook.com/) echoed in my head:

>Beauty is palpable, while intentions and objectives are largely invisible.

In all of their detailed slides and explanations, the majority of presentations failed to answer one simple question:

>Why?

So, I asked. From that simple question emerged several conversations about the real-world problems their users faced and how these designs solved those problems. Following the showcase, these conversations continued as a small group of students formed an audience for an impromptu Q&A.

My experience that evening opened my eyes to something I’ve long been ignoring. Though I have gained much through the wonderful sharing that happens within our community, I have offered little in return. I have published a few blog posts here and there about my process, what I have given back has paled in comparison to what I have received.

And so, in the time since that fateful evening I have been volunteering as a mentor for subsequent UX design students, answering questions they have about the industry, offering ideas and suggestions for their projects, and getting to know their motivations for entering this field of work.

Of all of the conversations we’ve had thus far, the most meaningful have focused on defining and understanding the problem the students are trying to solve.

One such conversation took place my very first evening. Having introduced myself and learned why each student was taking the course and what they hoped to achieve in the design industry, I asked what problems they were working on. The first group to speak up was working on a deeply personal and noteworthy problem:

>How should we design these filters?

Ok, so not very personal or noteworthy. I dug in deeper. The data they were filtering was real-time behavioural and medical data collected through a monitoring device worn by a child with a disability.

OK, now we’re getting fucking personal.

I moved the students from the kitchen table to the whiteboard to dig into who would be using the app and why. They explained that parents, teachers, and support workers all had a need to understand the environmental and physiological factors that impacted their child’s ability to live a happy, fulfilled life. These caregivers needed to have a fast and intuitive method of capturing experiences throughout the day and the means to combine that information with the data collected through the monitor to make informed decisions for how to optimally support the child’s development.

So, I asked:

>Who the fuck needs filters?

The students glanced at one another, dumbstruck by my &mdash; admittedly &mdash; vulgar inquiry. They realized what I was getting at. The problem they were trying to solve wasn’t how to filter reams of data. The problem they were trying to solve was how to make the life of a disabled child demonstrably better.

We didn’t get into solutions that night. I packed up my bag and walked home over the Burrard St bridge and dreamt of ways this product could help dear friends of mine, friends raising children who need constant support at home and at school, friends who wake up every day knowing that if they can just help their sons and daughters live a happy and fulfilled life and develop into thriving members of society, they’ve lived a good day.

The students working on that project stood proud the day of their showcase. My second time attending but my first having gotten to know the students beforehand, I have to admit I felt a tinge of pride myself. As they walked the audience through their presentation, they explained the situation many families face each and every day. The struggle, heartache, and desperation faced by countless fathers, mothers, teachers, and support workers to provide their young with an enriched and joyful life, and the tool they designed to help these caregivers improve their ability to do so. 

The screenshots were beautiful, to be sure, but what impressed me most was the obvious thought and care that went into the solution they had created. They understood that the problem being solved went deeper than filtering disparate bits of data, and created a design that spoke to the heart of the matter: providing actionable information to those who care for kids with disabilities.

And yes, there were filters.

What we do as designers isn’t superficial. Our calling is not to pick fonts or polish icons. It’s not to build websites or post dribbbles. These are a means to an end (and, sometimes, a hell of a lot of fun). Our calling is to help people observe, understand, and improve the world around them. To solve problems through empathy, compassion, and love.

We light paths to a healthier, safer, and happier life.
