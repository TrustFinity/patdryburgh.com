At the heart of craftsmanship is the pursuit of constant improvement. Everything can always be made better, and it is the responsibility of the craftsman to continue learning his or her craft each and every day.

As a designer, I've been working to improve my craft since the age of 21 when I got my start building websites using Photoshop, [Imageready][IR], and [Microsoft Frontpage][MP]. Over nearly a decade I have continued to develop new skills, expand my knowledge, and improve my craft.

This past week, the design team at Brewhouse experimented with a process new to the three of us called a [Design Sprint][DS]. Developed and popularized by the [design team at Google Ventures][GV], the design sprint takes a product's stakeholders and those intending to design and build it through a 5-day design process encompassing 5 phases: understanding, diverging, converging, prototyping, and testing. Each of these phases ebb and flow through any product design process, but the 5-day design sprint allows designers and product owners to quickly and efficiently prototype and test a design solution.

It did not go as well as I'd hoped.

I believe there are a few key reasons why we did not accomplish all of the goals set out at the start of our design sprint, but before I address those reasons, it's probably best to establish what our goals were:

1. To gain a better understanding of running a design sprint as outlined by teams like Google Ventures and [Thoughtbot][TB].
2. To attempt scheduling the standard 5-day sprint within Brewhouse's standard 4-day client work week (we generally save Fridays to work on administrative tasks and activities intended to improve our knowledge and skill sets).
3. To design, prototype, and test a new interface for the newsletter builder in [Goodbits][GB].

To say this week was an abject failure is entirely incorrect. We did improve our understanding of design sprints, especially the purpose and approach to the activities associated with each phase of the process. We technically *did* schedule the 5-day sprint into four days. And, we did make significant progress in our understanding of the problems we need to solve with the Goodbits newsletter builder.

However, as a craftsman it is my job to recognize both the good and the bad.

## Here's the bad

There were two fundamental flaws in our approach to this week's design sprint. 

First, scheduling our first sprint into a 4 day schedule was a mistake. Our team had never completed a design sprint together, and thus spent more time than we had planned understanding each activity and its role in the process. I believe as we gain a deeper understanding of each activity, we will develop the ability to move from activity to activity far more fluidly.

By scheduling the 5 phases of the design sprint over a 5-day week, each phase experiences a natural beginning and end. You can show up to the office, begin the day's phase, and be more relaxed knowing that you won't have to switch mental contexts until the day is done. The cognitive expenditure of switching from phase to the next in the middle of a day proved to be rather taxing on us. This is likely exasperated by the fact that the process was new to us, but I'm not sure that's entirely to blame.

As each phase of the process builds upon its antecedent, it is important that as a team you are able to carry each phase through to its natural completion. There should be no lingering doubt that the goals established for each phase were successfully accomplished. By scheduling each phase down to the minute, I felt not enough time was left to reflect as activities were being completed, causing us to rush through decisions just to keep moving forward with the process. Because of this, many activities were merely half-completed or worse, ignored altogether.

Second, the time scheduled for the design sprint was not kept sacred. Though we had scheduled our activities down to the minute, interruptions throughout the week caused our forward momentum to become inert. I bare much of the responsibility for this â€” I accepted requests for meetings at times when I knew I was meant to be focused on the sprint. Back when I was a freelancer, these interruptions could be mitigated by the fact that I was working alone more often than not. When two other people are waiting for you to wrap up a podcast that was rescheduled to a time you were all meant to be prototyping, it can be tragically debilitating to progress.

A design sprint, by its very nature, is a communal activity. Larger teams like Google Ventures and Thoughtbot are able to apply far more resources to a design sprint than a team of Brewhouse's size, so with just the three of us participating in this week's design sprint, losing one member for any length of time causes a 33% loss of available resources and an even higher drop-off of productivity. There were several times I felt I was being brought back up to speed with what I had missed being discussed. Perhaps this would be mitigated by better documentation, but that too requires either further resources to be assigned to the sprint or a slow down in productivity on the part of those participating.

## The elephant in the room

Though I would hesitate to argue that this last criticism deserves as much indictment as the issues discussed above, I would be remiss not to mention it. The room where we engaged in this week's sprint was our board room. Brewhouse works in a loft apartment which has been converted into an office, and our board room is a dark, narrow room with windows looking out at the brick wall two feet away, and a sliding door which acts as a somewhat ineffective white board.

But worst of all are the chairs. Because of Brewhouse's general disdain for meetings, a decision was made early on to purchase chairs which would act as a deterrent from spending too much time in the board room. However, if collaboration is a value that we care about at Brewhouse, we should care about designing a space that best supports our collaborative efforts. There were many times I simply wished not to be in that room, even though the actual work we were performing was both challenging and engaging.

## What's next?

This week I plan to schedule a retrospective on our initial design sprint, so we can do it again the following week for another area of Goodbits. I want this process to be ingrained in us to the point where it becomes routine, so that the output of our work is of the utmost quality.
